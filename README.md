FIT CTU - BIK-KAB (Cryptography and Security)

## Annotation
Students will understand the mathematical foundations of cryptography and gain an overview of current encryption algorithms. They will be able to use cryptographic keys and certificates in systems based on them, and will learn the basics of the secure use of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic systems and hashing functions in applications. Through exercises, they will acquire practical skills in using standard cryptographic methods with an emphasis on security and will also become familiar with basic cryptanalysis techniques.
